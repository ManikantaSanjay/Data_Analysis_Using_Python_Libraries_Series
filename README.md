### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Downloading the Dataset :
#### By making use of the opendatasets library we download the dataset required for our EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)
#### Dataset URL : https://www.kaggle.com/shrutimehta/zomato-restaurants-data :link:

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Importing Dataset : 
#### By making use of the pandas library we import the dataset into a pandas dataframe.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Analysis and Visualization:
It deals with  the following aspects : 
#### -> Understanding the Geographical Spread 
#### -> Understanding the Rating Aggregate, Color and Text
#### -> Understanding the Country and their Respective Currency
#### -> Understanding the Online Delivery Distribution
#### -> Understanding the Coverage of the City

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Asking and Answering Questions:

#### After understanding the several insights about the restaurants present in the survey, we try to answer them using data frame operations and visualizations.
#### We ask the following questions:

Q1: From which Locality Maximum hotels are listed in Zomato ?

Q2: What kind of Cuisine these highly rates restaurants offer ?

Q3: How many of such restaurants accept online delivery ?

Q4: Understanding the Restaurants Rating locality wise ?

Q5: Understanding the Relation between Rating VS Cost of Dining ?

Q6: Location of Highly Rated restaurants across New Delhi ?

Q7: Understaning about Common Eateries ?

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Inferences and Conclusions

#### We've drawn many inferences from the survey and we discuss them in this part of the project.
